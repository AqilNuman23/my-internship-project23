# About this Project
During my Internship, I am responsible to redesign the old website's corperate to new branding guidelines.
All of these were being made from March to August 2023.
I'm using [Figma](https://figma.com/) at first to construct the first layout and develop them using only HTML & CSS.
To make the redraw process faster, I'm using [Wireframe.cc](https://www.wireframe.cc/) as it is an excellent website plus user friendly.
